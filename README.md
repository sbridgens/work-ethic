# work-ethic

Just a bit of fun after seeing an image of this on some sales pitch

outputs the following

```bash
python workethic.py 
IF:
a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z

EQUALS:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26

THEN:
K+N+O+W+L+E+D+G+E
11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 = 96%

AND:
H+A+R+D+W+O+R+K
8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98%

BUT:
A+T+T+I+T+U+D+E
1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100%


```

Worth playing with the values/chars for more interesting results....
